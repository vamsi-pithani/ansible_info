#handlers are special tasks that only get executed when triggered via the notify directive. 
#handlers are executed at the end of the play, once all tasks are finished.
#In Ansible, handlers are typically used to start, reload, restart, and stop services.
#If your playbook involves changing configuration files, there is a high chance that 
#youâ€™ll need to restart a service so that the changes take effect.
